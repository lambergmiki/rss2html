## Generate HTML templates from RSS feeds

With the help of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml-js">xml-js</a>, RSS-URLs are processed and transformed into RSS feeds, packaged as simple HTML, ready to be embedded on your website.

News! As of 17/10-2025 the output includes the feed as a structured array, allowing for easier manipulation, e.g. sorting and filtering items.

_Note: This project was primarily created as part of a university course assignment and is therefore a learning exercise, rather than an actual module for public use. With that said, feel free to use the module as you wish._

## How does it work?

rss2html takes a raw RSS-feed URL and processes it in multiple steps to finally deliver HTML-ready code you can copy and paste to your website and style as you wish.

Import the function `convertRssToHtml` from the package as shown below, paste your RSS-feed URL as an argument and run it in Node with the command `node <your-filename>.js`. `Console.log()` the result and paste the output into your .html-file.

#### Example in Node.js

```javascript
import { convertRssToHtml } from "rss2html";

const result = await convertRssToHtml(url);
console.log(result);
```

#### Example output
